## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to defeat the opposing Mechanic by dealing more Wounds to them then they deal to you. You will achieve this goal by collecting a pile of scrap (your deck), building Scrapbots, and generating Energy to power your Scrapbot attacks.

### Setup

Each player starts with an initial personal deck consisting of 4 Spare Parts and 4 Circuitry. Put the 20 Brain Damage (Wound) cards face-up in a stack near the play area. All remaining cards are shuffled and become the main deck. A row of 3 empty spaces in front of each player represent the Lanes which Scrapbots will be built in. Deal 5 cards from the main deck face-up as the Market. Each player draws a starting hand, the player going first may only draw three cards for the starting hand. The player going second draws five. Players will take turns, with control passing to the other player after each draw phase.

### Turn Phases

Each turn, the following phases occur:

**Main Phase**

- take actions or choose to pass

**Discard Phase**

- discard any cards remaining in your hand

**Cleanup Phase**

- unused Scrap and Energy is removed from your pool
- Ready (turn vertical) any Exhausted Scrapbots in your Lanes

**Draw Phase**

- draw a hand of 5 cards. If at any point in the game you need to draw a card but are unable to because your deck is empty, shuffle your discard pile and it becomes your deck.
- If you have any Wounds in your hand, discard all of them. Draw 2 cards for each Wound discarded this way. This effect may only occur once per turn.
- Turn passes to the other player

### Actions

You may perform the following actions any number of times during your Main Phase:

- Gain Scrap
- Gain Energy
- Buy cards from the Market
- Build a Scrapbot
- Activate a Component
- Attack with a Scrapbot

**Gain Scrap**
Discard any card from your hand to add its Scrap value to your pool. You do not gain Energy when a card is discarded for Scrap.

**Gain Energy from a Component**
Discard a Component card from your hand to add its Energy value to your pool. You do not gain Scrap when a card is discarded for Energy. You do not resolve its Activate effect.

**Gain Energy from a Resource**
Discard a Resource card from your hand to add its Energy value to your pool. You do not gain Scrap when a card is discarded for Energy. You may choose to follow the "Energy" card text.

**Buy cards from the Market**
Remove Scrap from your pool equal to the value of a card in the Market and add that card to your discard pile. Whenever a card is removed from the Market, deal a new card to the Market from the main deck.

**Build a Scrapbot**
Play a Scrapbot from your hand into an empty Lane. Scrapbots cannot be moved or replaced from their Lane once they have been built. Scrapbots remain in play until destroyed. Scrapbots enter play Exhausted (turned sideways). There are only 3 Lanes to build in so you cannot have more than 3 Scrapbots in play at once.

**Activate a Component**
Choose one of your Ready Scrapbots to activate the Component. Play a Component card from your hand and follow the card text then put that card into your discard pile. You do not gain Scrap or Energy when using this effect.

You may not Activate a component if you do not have a Ready Scrapbot in play.

**Attack with a Scrapbot**
Only Scrapbots that are Ready may attack.

Exhaust (turn sideways) a Scrapbot to indicate that it has used an attack.

You must choose to use a Scrapbot attack that has an Energy cost less than or equal to the amount of Energy currently in your pool.

#### Dealing Damage

If there is a Scrapbot in the Lane being dealt damage, add damage counters to the opposing Scrapbot to represent the damage dealt. Damage can only be removed from a Repair effect.

*Dealing Splash Damage*
Splash damage is dealt to Lanes that are adjacent to the source of damage. E.g. If a Scrapbot deals splash damage from the center lane, then both the left and right lane would receive damage. However, if a Scrapbot were to deal damage from the left (or right) lane, it would only deal splash damage to the adjacent (center) lane.

*Destroying Scrapbots*
If the damage dealt after an attack would equal or exceed the amount of Health that the opposing Scrapbot has, that Scrapbot is destroyed. Place the destroyed Scrapbot in its owner's discard pile.

Excess damage is ignored (i.e. does not carry over to damage the opposing player).

*Dealing Wounds*
If there is no Scrapbot in an attacked Lane then the opposing player is dealt 1 Wound for each 10 points of undefended damage. Wounds are placed in your opponents discard pile.


### Winning the Game

The game ends when the last Wound has been dealt. Each player adds up all Wounds in their hand, deck, and discard pile. The player with the least Wounds is the winner!
