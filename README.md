## About This Repo

This repository contains the rulebook and various files used to generate a playable prototype for the game: Scrapbots. Check out the [License](#license). Browse the [card gallery](#card-list). I'd love it if you'd [playtest on Tabletop Simulator](#tabletop-simulator) and send me some feedback. 

## Summary

Scrapbots is a deck-building card-battler game set in a post-apocalyptic junk-punk future (Mad Max with robots). You take on the role of a Mechanic, a warlord who commands the remnants of robot armies against their enemies. These warlords are in constant conflict to control the last bits of humanity’s resources. Collect a pile of scrap and cobble together some Scrapbots to smash your opponent.

Scrapbots takes inspiration from deck-building games such as Dominion, Star Realms/Hero Realms, Nightfall and Ascension. It is also inspired by card-battle style games such as Pokemon, KeyForge, Magic: The Gathering and Yu-gi-oh.

## Design Goals

The goal of Scrapbots design is to be a fast-paced card-battler that does not require collecting cards or constructing decks. It also aims to be a deck-building game with an emphasis on persistent board elements and hand optimization. It should be easy to learn but still have enough depth to maintain a competitive player’s interest. Games are intended to last ~30 minutes.

## Feedback

This game is a work-in-progress. I'd love to hear your feedback, watch recordings of play, you can even modify the game and send me a pull request.
