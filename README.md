## About This Repo

This repository contains the rulebook and various files used to generate a playable prototype for the game: Scrapbots. Check out the [License](#license). Browse the [card gallery](#card-list). I'd love it if you'd [playtest on Tabletop Simulator](#tabletop-simulator) and send me some feedback. 

## Summary

Scrapbots is a deck-building card-battler game set in a post-apocalyptic junk-punk future (Mad Max with robots). You take on the role of a Mechanic, a warlord who commands the remnants of robot armies against their enemies. These warlords are in constant conflict to control the last bits of humanity’s resources. Collect a pile of scrap and cobble together some Scrapbots to smash your opponent.

## Design Goals

The goal of Scrapbots design is to be a quick-to-play, fast-paced card battler that is easy to learn but still has enough strategic/tactical depth to maintain a serious player’s interest. Scrapbots games are intended to last ~30 minutes.
